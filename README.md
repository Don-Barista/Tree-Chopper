# Tree-Chopper
Hello and Welcome to the repository of the Tree-Chopper website. Hope you enjoy our web broswer game project!

## Inspiration:

Our team is comprised of rather inexperienced programmers who wanted to make a fairly simple yet challenging project for our first hackathon.

## What it does
Our web page is essentially a Cookie Clicker clone in which you click a tree to collect wood and you can spend that wood to buy upgrades to collect wood faster.

## How we built it
We built this code using fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
Using GitHub was very challenging for us as none of us really knew how to use it. None of us knew JavaScript and some of us only knew the basics of HTML and CSS prior to joining this hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a website that accomplishes the primary goal we had initially planned, which was to make a game that would entice its players to waste their times playing it.

## What we learned
We learned how to work in a team using GitHub and the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What's next for Tree Chopper
We plan on polishing the aesthetics of the UI and maybe adding a few extra upgrades to make the game last longer. This project can be seen as a stepping stone to greater things for us.

## Built With
HTML,CSS, and JavaScript
